                <h4>Kiyomizu Temple</h4>
                <p>A visit to Kiyomizu-dera in the wooded hills east of Kyoto is like travelling back in time.
                    Kiyomizu-dera ("Pure Water Temple") is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most
                    celebrated
                    temples in the whole country. Kiyomizu Temple is best known for its 13-metre high wooden
                    platform
                    that juts out from the main hall.</p>

                <h4>Kinkakuji Temple</h4>
                <p>Kinkakuji Temple is one of the most visited attractions of Kyoto. Literally meaning "Temple of
                    the
                    Golden Pavilion," this Zen Buddhist shrine is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It's a breathtaking
                    piece of architecture and is surrounded by a Japanese style garden. Known by many as Rokuonji or
                    the
                    Deer Garden Temple, Kinkakuji was built in 1397.</p>

                <h4>Yasaka Shrine</h4>
                <p>Yasaka Shrine, a beautiful 5-storey pagoda in the east of Kyoto is all that remains of a great
                    temple
                    that once stood here. Also called the Gion Shrine, it's the centrepiece of the annual Gion
                    Festival.
                    Built in the 7th century, the enshrined Shinto deity Susanoo-no-Mikoto symbolises prosperity and
                    protection against pestilence.</p>
